# How to use Clipcards

Clipcards easily works with most spreadsheet programs. Just use your favorite spreadsheet program to fill in the vocabulary you want to turn into flashcards, copy the spreadsheet cells, and paste them to the Clipcards Create Flashcards page. Clipcards will automatically create the flashcards for you.

## Spreadsheet Format
![clipcard spreadsheet diagram](/Clipcards%20Spreadsheet%20Diagram.png)

Clipcards work with the following spreadsheet column format:
1. **Learning Language (required)**
2. Pronounciation (optional)
3. **Known Language (required)**
4. When in the video/audio clip the vocabulary was spoken (in seconds) (optional)
5. Link to the webpage with the video or audio (optional)

If you are making Clipcards that only require the learning language and the language you know the spreadsheet should only be two columns wide. You do not need to include the optional columns if you don't need them. Here is an example.

## Sample spreadsheet for an English-speaker learning Spanish:

The most basic language learning spreadsheet would only have 2 columns. The left column is the language you are learning and the right column should be the language you know. You can see a sample Spanish spreadsheet [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HmpwskKILdQWSs8GHoQ1FAPGu80at_nj90Ctqg_gs9U/edit?usp=sharing).

## Sample spreadsheet for a Chinese-speaker learning english from a Youtube Video:
![learning english example](/english-example.png)

This example includes a Youtube video. Each row in the spreadsheet has 4 columns. Learning language, known language, timestamp in the video (in seconds), and a link to the video. You can see a sample English spreadsheet with Youtube video [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DBz6FHZ0Xt_hEuxcyRTB9t9zf0A2Cs7_YXraY-5yX0c/edit?usp=sharing).
