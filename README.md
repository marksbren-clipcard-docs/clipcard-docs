# How to use Clipcards

Clipcards easily works with most spreadsheet programs. Just use your favorite spreadsheet program to fill in the vocabulary you want to turn into flashcards, copy the spreadsheet cells, and paste them to the Clipcards Create Flashcards page. Clipcards will automatically create the flashcards for you.

Clipcards work with the following spreadsheet format:
1. **Learning Language (required)**
2. Pronounciation (optional)
3. **Known Language (required)**
4. When in the video/audio clip the vocabulary was spoken (optional)
5. Link to the webpage with the video or audio (optional)

If you are making Clipcards that only require the learning language and the language you know the spreadsheet should only be two columns wide. You do not need to include the optional columns if you don't need them. Here is an example.
